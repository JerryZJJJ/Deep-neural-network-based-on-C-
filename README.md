# Deep-neural-network-based-on-C-

This project was motivated by Andy752 who has build the inital framework to realize the simplest DNN with relu and sigmoid activation function. Thanks to Andy752.

## New functions:
* Realize multi-classification task using softmax output layer
* Add tanh activation function
* Add Iris datasets to test
